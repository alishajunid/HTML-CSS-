    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put sauce on first, before 
        you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>Or, if you put cheese on then the sauce it's 
        messed up too</h4>


    <p class="special">Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are certain things you have to do first. Like making the 
        base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the suace, add the 
        toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut 
        and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do 
        start out in the same way as long as you follow the 
        order correctly. You can have everything you need to 
        make many different pizzas using the same base 
        structure that is set up before hand.</p>

    <h5 class="special">This is how you make a pizza</h5>
    <p><small>There are some specific steps you need to take to make a
